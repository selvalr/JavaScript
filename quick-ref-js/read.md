### What is Javascript

- javascript is a High level,interpreted programming language
-object based pograming language
- Conforms to the ECMAScript specification
- Multi-Paradigm
- Runs on the client/browser as well on the server(Node.js)


### Why learn javascript

-It is the programming language of browser
- build very interactive user interface with  framework likereact
- used in building very fast server side and full stack application
- used in mobile development (react native,nativeScript,Ionic)
- usedin desktop application development (Electron JS)


### who uses javascript?

- all those social media website 

### What you will learn in this course

1).Variable & Data Types
2).Arrays
3).Object Literals
4).Method for string ,arrays,object,etc
5).Loops-for,while,for....of,forEach,map
6).Conditionals(if,ternary & switch)
7).Function(normal & arrow)
8).OOP(prototype & classes)
9).DOM Selection
10).DOM Manipulation
11).Events
12).Basic Form Validation

1).variables 

# var
var x=10,var x=10;-->function scope two time declare var same value allowed,
# let
let x=10,x=20; -->blockscope two time declare value not allowed,  let x = 5;x=6;
# const
const price1=10,const price2=10;---> These prices are constant values, and cannot be changed.


2).arrays

let cars=["saab","volovo"];



3).loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


4). condition

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

if - to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
 else - to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
else if  - to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
switch - to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



5).comparison & operators

Comparison Operators
        Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

        Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:

==	equal to	                x == 8	false	
                                        x == 5	true	
                                        x == "5"true	

===	equal value and equal type	x === 5  true	
                                        x === "5"	false	


!=	not equal	                x != 8	true	

!==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
                                                x !== "5"	true	
                                                x !== 8	true	

>	greater than	                        x > 8	false	

<	less than	x < 8	true	

>=	greater than or equal to	x >= 8	false	
<=	less than or equal to	x <= 8	true


logical operator:&&AND,OR ||,NOT !

Conditional (Ternary) Operator:variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2 

6).object

7).function

8).program flow

9).data types

10).prototypes

11).events


### JAVASCRIPT comment

single line comment - // is a single line comment  shortcut:ctrl+/
multi line comment - /**/ is a multi line comments

### js is weakly typed

simple type system -number,string,boolean,date,function, array,object
special type - Nan,null,undefiend,



 ### Quotes
  \' - its a single quote
  \" - its a double quates
  \\ - backslash
  \n - new line
  \r - carriage return
  \t - tab
  \b - bsckspace
  \f - form feed
 
 
 ## dot operater

 .push()-value is a array new valude added
 .length-is a array length
 .sort()-order a array element align
 .reverse()-reverse the keyword
